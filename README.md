# Simple-Framing-System
*Original Repo Privated

The aim of this project was to develop a Frame cost estimator for different sizes of art pieces. All error checking/input validation was required to be implemented in PHP. An opt in feature was included to have quotes emailed to a given email address, and to save the quote to a database using SQL. The PHP converts any valid unit of measurement to metres internally in order to validate size limitations and presents a cost in correct decimal form. A price is calculated given a specific equation taking into account postage method and size of frame and rounded appropriately. A getrequests.php page also displays all entries in the database.
